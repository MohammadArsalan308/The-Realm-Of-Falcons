# The Realm Of Falcons
Automated vulnerability scanners are employed by security teams to inspect their endpoints for vulnerabilities and various loopholes. Eliminating blind spots is the basis of successful vulnerability management and security of any organization. Even if patches exist for vulnerabilities, most organizations still fall prey because of their lack of awareness about them. If exploited, vulnerabilities can further proliferate into large-scale security breaches that might lead to financial losses or major data leaks in the affected organizations.

The Realm of Falcons is a high-performance offensive security reconnaissance & multi-tool web vulnerability scanner. The tool scans any given web application, gather reconnaissance, identifies technologies used and then performs various vulnerability checks. It is designed for black box testing (it does not study the source code) of the web application. At last, the tool generates a comprehensive report in a portable document format with complete details.
